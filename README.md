Try not to die in a fire

A port of Notch's game he created for lundum dare 24 to android.

I added game saving and a terrible terrible dpad that glitches out sometimes.

I don't have time to work on this anymore but will accept fixes and release them in the android app store.

To build you will need to use an old version of the android sdk prior to android-17 that uses ant.

Then just run:

    $ ant debug install  

to build and install it on your device.

Try the game on your device here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lols.diaf

Do whatever you want this code but change the name to something original for your project.
